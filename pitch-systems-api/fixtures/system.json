The diatonic was akin to the contemporary diatonic; chromatic made use of of more semitones, and the enharmonic smaller intervals again, roughly equivalent to about half a semitone. As with other areas of culture, Ancient Greek music theory had a lasting and prominent effect on music theory and tuning in Europe and the Arab world.
